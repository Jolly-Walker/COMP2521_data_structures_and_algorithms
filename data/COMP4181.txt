COMP4181 Language-based Software Safety  
Trust in the safety and security of software systems is increasingly important
with the use of software in systems where failure or sabotage can
lead to loss of life or be very expensive  this includes medical
and financial applications as well as software used for power grids, amss
transport systems, and security infrastructure. This course covers language based safety engineering
techniques advanced type systems, specification-based test generators, domain-specific languages, and prototyping for
high-assurance. It demonstrates via concrete examples, including security infrastructure software, how modern
functional languages are used to achieve high assurance, and conveys hands-on experience
via practical assignments.
