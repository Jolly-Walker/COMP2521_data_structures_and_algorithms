COMP3151 Foundations of Concurrency  
Concurrency = processes + communication. Communication via shared variables vs message passing.
Models of concurrency: true concurrency vs interleaving. Abstractions: atomicity, locks and barriers,
semaphores, monitors, threads, RPC, rendezvous. Classical problems: mutual exclusion, dining philosophers, sleeping
barber, termination detection, gravitational N-body problem.Practical work: programming assignments using the C-like
language MDP.
