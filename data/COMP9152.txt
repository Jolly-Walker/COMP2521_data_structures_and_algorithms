COMP9152 Modelling Concurrent Systems  
This course tries to make students familiar with state-of-the-art techniques in modelling
concurrent systems. This is done by comparing some of the more successful
models of concurrency found in the literature. The focus will be on
the rationale behind the design decisions underlying those models, viewed from philosophical,
mathematical and computational perspectives. The course contains important background knowledge for students
aiming at a scientific career in which the design of mathematical models
of system behaviour is a component.  
Topics chosen from: semantic models of concurrent and distributed systems  e.g. process
algebra, event structures, Petri nets, Chu spaces, operational and denotational semantics, semantic
equivalences and implementation relations, linear versus branching time, interleaving versus partial order
semantics, true concurrency, algorithms for equivalence checking and their complexity, modal and
temporal logic for concurrent systems.
