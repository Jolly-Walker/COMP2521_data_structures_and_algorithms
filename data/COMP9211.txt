COMP9211 Computer Architecture  
Study the architecture & organisation of modern processors, and influences upon these,
with emphasis on pipelined RISC machines; gain understanding of the design of
the memory subsystem, I/O, and system level interconnect; become proficient in the
use of tools such as VHDL and SimpleScalar for the description, simulation,
and verification of architectural designs; complete a series of assignments leading to
the design, implementation, validation and assessment of a RISC system. It is
assumed students are familiar with combinational and sequential logic design principles and
have some experience in the use of CAD tools to describe and
simulate digital systems.
